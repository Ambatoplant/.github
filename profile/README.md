## About the Project

Indonesia is home to an incredible diversity of flora, but rapid industrialization and habitat destruction have placed many species at risk. Recognizing this challenge, our team developed **AmbatoPlant**, an innovative solution that combines **machine learning**, **mobile development**, and **cloud computing** to promote environmental awareness and sustainability. By empowering users to identify plants and access care information instantly, we aim to foster a deeper connection with nature and encourage conservation efforts.

## üß© **Project Highlights**

### üöÄ **How We Got Here**
Our team embarked on a journey to create a solution that could assist with environmental awareness and plant identification. Recognizing the importance of protecting biodiversity and the environment, we envisioned **AmbatoPlant** as a way to empower users to identify plants through machine learning, with the goal of educating and promoting sustainable practices. The app integrates modern technology to provide instant, accessible plant care information, fostering a greater appreciation for nature.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Scope**
- **Plant Identification with Machine Learning**  
  - Users can take photos of plants, and the app will identify them using a trained classification model.
  - The app provides detailed information about the identified plant, including care tips, benefits, and planting methods.

- **Features for Users**  
  - **Plant Identification**: Uses machine learning to identify plants through photos.  
  - **Care Tips**: Provides information on how to care for the identified plants.  
  - **Plant Benefits**: Offers insights into the ecological and health benefits of each plant.  
  - **Planting Methods**: Recommends the best planting techniques and environmental conditions.  
  - **Cloud-Based Updates**: Ensures that users always have access to the latest plant data and model improvements.

- **Sustainability Focus**  
  - AmbatoPlant supports reforestation and conservation efforts, educating users about the importance of biodiversity and the role of plants in maintaining ecological balance.

### üì¶ **Deliverables**
- A mobile application that allows users to:  
  - Take pictures of plants and receive instant identification results.  
  - Access detailed plant information, including care instructions, benefits, and planting methods.   
  - Contribute to environmental sustainability through the educational content provided.

## üå± **Technical Specifications**

### **Machine Learning**
- A classification model with 15 classes has been created using **InceptionV3**'s pretrained model, fine-tuned to our specific needs.  
- A data pipeline serves the models, preprocessing data through resizing and normalization to improve accuracy and efficiency.

### **Mobile Development**
- Deployment of **TensorFlow Lite** for running the trained model on mobile devices.
- The app will display prediction results along with benefit data and care tips sourced from the **Firebase database**.

### **Cloud Computing**
- Implementation of a **least privilege access model** for team members, ensuring secure and restricted access to the system.
- The machine learning team has been granted access to cloud storage for plant data results and images.
- Deployment of the API on **Cloud Run** ensures reliable and scalable access to plant identification results for users.
